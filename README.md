# Path Planner for Differntial Drive Robots

## Problem Statement

A circular roomba robot is present in an already mapped environment. The map is in the format of a binary occupancy
grid.
<p align="center"><img src="assets/grid-example.png" width="50%"></p>

Each cell in the grid contains a boolean value indicating if an obstacle is present at a given location, i.e `true -> obstacle` and `false -> free`. The `OccupancyGrid` struct contains a 1d array of boolean
that denotes a 2d grid in a row major format. The intent is to find a safe **collision-free** path from a given location
to the vicinity of the goal location.

The PathPlanner classes inherits the `PathPlannerInterface` class, and implements the `getCollisionFreePath()` pure virtual function to provide a trajectory which can be followed by the robot. Note that the start position and goal position may be any point within the occupancy grid.

## System Description

### Grid

The origin of the occupancy grid is the bottom left of the image. The positive x-axis is to the right and positive
y-axis is upwards. The grid is of size `320 x 320` with a resolution of `0.05 m`. The `OccupancyGrid` class has methods
to set occupancy for a given coordinate, which could be useful for testing solutions.

### Robot

The robot is a spherical robot of diameter `0.6m` and it operates with a 2d coordinate system with $(x.y. \theta)$ where
$\theta$ is the yaw(orientation) of the robot.

## Dependencies

### Eigen

Eigen is a linear algebra library. Documentation to use Eigen is present
[here](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__QuickRefPage.html). A cheat sheet with quick usages for Eigen Data
structures and functions can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/gocarlos/c91237b02c120c6319612e42fa196d77)

To install Eigen, run the following command:
```
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
```
### Yaml-cpp
Yaml-cpp library is used to parse config.yml.
```
sudo apt install libyaml-cpp-dev
```
